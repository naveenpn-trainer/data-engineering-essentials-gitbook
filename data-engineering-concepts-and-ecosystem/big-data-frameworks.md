# Big Data Frameworks

There are several frameworks available to handle big data, each suited to different aspects of big data processing and analysis. Here are some of the most popular and widely used frameworks:

1. **Apache Hadoop** : An open-source framework that allows for the distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers using simple programming models. It includes:
   - HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System): For storage.
   - MapReduce: For processing.
   - YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator): For resource management.
2. **Apache Spark** : An open-source unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing. It provides an interface for programming entire clusters with implicit data parallelism and fault tolerance. It supports:
   - Batch processing.
   - Stream processing.
   - Machine learning (MLlib).
   - Graph processing (GraphX).
   - SQL (Spark SQL).
3. **Apache Flink** : A stream-processing framework that provides distributed processing for both batch and stream data flows. It's known for its low-latency and high-throughput capabilities.
4. **Apache Kafka** : A distributed streaming platform that can publish, subscribe to, store, and process streams of records in real time. Often used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications.

**Cassandra** : A highly scalable, distributed NoSQL database designed to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers, providing high availability with no single point of failure.
